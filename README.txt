Hi Google! My Github is for you right now! Please read the application letter here and briefly scan my works!

FMC_ASSET_OPTIMIZATION - work experience during Summer 2016, came into part of this exploratory codebase in Python and contributed heavily, other enterprise tools used the information from these notebooks to create a model

ECE391-OSLAB - operating systems class, built core linux from near-scratch over a semester with a team of four (actually just two, the other two were useless)

ECE448-AI	- I wrote a nice Java solution to a simple problem (calculating Bayes probabilities) that allows for maximum user capability
